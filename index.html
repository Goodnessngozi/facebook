        <p>
            Hello lovely people. Pls your suggestions / advice is welcome here. <br> <br>

            Am getting married soon . The days of heart break and all that are over. It's time to smile, love and trust again. <br>
            She's been my best friend for a long time. We shared all our secrets with each other. I finally asked her to marry me and She said yes. <br> <br>

            Our budget for white wedding is 250k. We want a small wedding besides things are difficult now and she understood i'm not financially buoyant now , but we both loved ourselves. <br> <br>

            These is the list I came up with : <br><br>
